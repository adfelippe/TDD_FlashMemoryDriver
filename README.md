### TDD Led Driver

This is an Flash Memory Driver project developed using TDD.
It's based on James W. Grenning's Test-Driven Development for Embedded C book.

The only difference is that this test uses ceedling instead of plain unity or CppUTest.
Firstly install ceedling and then run `ceedling` to run all the tests.
Ceedling has plenty of documentation around, so be happy! :)
